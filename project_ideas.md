## 🎯 SUBSCRIPTION COIN ($SUB) - Full Development

**Tagline:** "Pay Monthly Forever. Own Nothing. Love It."

### Core Concept
The subscription economy has trapped everyone. Netflix, Spotify, Adobe, Amazon Prime, Disney+, Apple everything, Microsoft 365, gym memberships, car subscriptions, software licenses... People are paying $200+ monthly for stuff they used to own. Perfect timing for satirical crypto commentary.

### Website Theme & Messaging
**Hero Section:**
- "Welcome to SUBSCRIPTION COIN - The Only Crypto That Never Stops Charging You"
- "Finally! A token that understands your monthly payment addiction"
- Big countdown timer: "Days until your next subscription payment: 3.2"

**Key Sections:**
1. **"Why Own When You Can Rent Forever?"**
   - List of everything now subscription-based
   - Calculator showing monthly vs lifetime costs
   - "Ownership is so 2019" messaging

2. **"Subscription Tiers"** (Mock pricing)
   - Basic SUB: $9.99/month (you get nothing)
   - Premium SUB: $19.99/month (you get nothing, but faster)
   - Enterprise SUB: $99.99/month (you get nothing, with analytics)

3. **"Auto-Renewal Hell"**
   - Interactive "Cancel Subscription" button that doesn't work
   - "Are you sure?" confirmation loops
   - "Special offer to stay" pop-ups

4. **"Subscription Calculator"**
   - Input your actual subscriptions
   - Shows total monthly drain
   - "You could have bought a house" counter

### Visual Design Elements
- **Color scheme:** Corporate blue/white (like every SaaS company)
- **UI elements:** Subscription service mockups, payment forms
- **Animations:** Auto-charging wallet, subscription renewal notifications

### Community/Social Angle
  - "The token that auto-renews itself"
